The staff is highly competent, very well educated and most importantly, they love children. MEAP scores are amazing, but they aren't the primary focus. Also amazing are the character education programs, the art, music, gym, and library. Overall, it is very well-rounded program.",

How many times can you tell your child to be the bigger person and walk away? Everyday he had an altercation with someone. This School needs to be shut down! This School has no order at all. A lot of the kids are disrespectful, no lights in the hall way, leaking ceilings in the classrooms and in the gym. If you love your child please don't send him/her to this School. I'm rating it one star because I have too but this School is very very bad.",

The class sizes are small which allows for one on one instruction and enables them to easily meet their grade level goals and go beyond. St. Clare not only focuses on academics but it also nurtures each student's God given talents. Each teacher and staff member truly cares for each student and it is an environment that produces well educated, integrity driven, leaders for the future.",

I was finally happy to see that my students were being challenged academically and with forensics and other extras there were many outlets for students to express themselves. I was most disappointed and eventually removed my children due to the willingness to retain students with struggles instead of exercising concern and assistance to dig to the root of the problem. If your child is ADD, ADHD or has any other learning disability or possible disability, I cannot recommend this school. I brought my concerns and suspicions to both teachers and principal and the best they could do was to insist upon retention if we returned to St. Clare. I ultimately decided not to. The fallout, my children lost their circles that were developing quite nicely. That is sad to say especially given my oldest was entering 7th grade. Yet this was the right decision my youngest, who St. Clare, wanted to retain. He is in his proper grade and doing much better. With the help of his new school he is receiving the testing and teacher collaboration that was needed to help him be a successful student.",

It is diverse racially, economically, and spiritually. The children and teachers are hard-working and inspiring. The parents are involved and committed. There is a slew of after school activities from knitting club to the annual school musical -- which features a live orchestra and sells out the War Memorial theater for multiple performances every year. If you want your child to be challenged academically in an atmosphere that will prepare them for the real world, you cannot do better than St. Clare! From its outstanding principal to its wonderful staff and parents, St. Clare is committed to building character and leaders who know what's right -- and have the courage to do what's right.",

My child has been bullied since the start of the school year and they still haven't taken care of the problem. And to make matters worse the lunch staff is rude to the children. This is our first year ever dealing with DPS and our last. I don't want to send my child to another Michigan school.",

I was finally happy to see that my students were being challenged academically and with forensics and other extras there were many outlets for students to express themselves. I was most disappointed and eventually removed my children due to the willingness to retain students with struggles instead of exercising concern and assistance to dig to the root of the problem. If your child is ADD, ADHD or has any other learning disability or possible disability, I cannot recommend this school. I brought my concerns and suspicions to both teachers and principal and the best they could do was to insist upon retention if we returned to St. Clare. I ultimately decided not to. The fallout, my children lost their circles that were developing quite nicely. That is sad to say especially given my oldest was entering 7th grade. Yet this was the right decision my youngest, who St. Clare, wanted to retain. He is in his proper grade and doing much better. With the help of his new school he is receiving the testing and teacher collaboration that was needed to help him be a successful student.",

It is diverse racially, economically, and spiritually. The children and teachers are hard-working and inspiring. The parents are involved and committed. There is a slew of after school activities from knitting club to the annual school musical -- which features a live orchestra and sells out the War Memorial theater for multiple performances every year. If you want your child to be challenged academically in an atmosphere that will prepare them for the real world, you cannot do better than St. Clare! From its outstanding principal to its wonderful staff and parents, St. Clare is committed to building character and leaders who know what's right -- and have the courage to do what's right.",

We have not found one student or group of students to welcome our children into this school. My kids hate it here and we will be moving asap! Parents.. Teach your kids how to be welcoming to new students, students with less money and so forth. Most of all, teach your kids to be kind, caring and compassionate.

Perhaps those giving perfect reviews are the parents deeply involved in the school through family history of attending or volunteering. Anyway, the school is mostly white. Diversity is sports scholarships for Detroit kids. In all fairness Grosse Pointe is not culturally or ethnically diverse therefore 98% of kids are white. Most teachers are good & caring. Discipline policy for kids is basically the more influence your parents have at school the more likely you will not be held accountable. Pressure to donate money but that is common at private schools. Headmaster is aloof. He only says hello to rich families and walks past & ignores others like they don't exist. Recognition awards seem to go to kids whose parents volunteer a lot at the school. Kids at school are very nice and friendly. Most parents are nice. Good school but it is not Cranbrook or DCDS or Roeper. My kids actually love the school but it is academically average. I send them there for the environment which is great for my kids bec it is small & community oriented. Many issues I have described here are common at all private schools.",

No more honors classes leave the smart kids trapped with those who just want to have a good time and not learn. The administration told my family that I would be challenged, but man were they wrong. I was put in a lower level math class even though I am very smart, and they refused to move me up to the Honors track, even though I was awarded a Merit Scholarship and test extremely high.

My son Michael Frontera was a student here in 1982 - 1985 and is 30 now and attends a sheltered workshop situation in our hometown of Greenwood, SC. I believe the wonderful start he got and the therapies he received at FEC was the KEY in his development into the wonderful sweet young man he is now. Dorothy Martin was the \"principal\" at that time. I am so happy this school continues to serve the community. Tuition was very low then and we parents did alot of fundraising to keep the school afloat. Glad you're still floating!!!",

How many times can you tell your child to be the bigger person and walk away? Everyday he had an altercation with someone. This School needs to be shut down! This School has no order at all. A lot of the kids are disrespectful, no lights in the hall way, leaking ceilings in the classrooms and in the gym. If you love your child please don't send him/her to this School. I'm rating it one star because I have too but this School is very very bad.",

I had to put my children in Maybury elementary, a school i don't care for and I've been having problems with the principal stop ping me from entering the school and taking my son to class, i feel she's harassing me because i havnt seen her doing this to other parents at all. I wish i could get my kids to school at Spain I'd switch them back. A very sad and disappointed mother here. :'(",

Dr. Denise Davis-Cotton, the founder of DSA had a vision in which she was able to bring to fruition by talking with people such as Max Fisher, and other \"movers and shakers\" to get the process of building a school so that students that were creative, talented , scholarly, and interested in working towards excellence would be able to achieve their respective goals. Inasmuch as she did this, to vilify the school, the curriculum, and the staff is too much. As a former educator in the DPS, I fully understand and recognize the fact that there are problems in many schools, whether they are DPS schools or schools throughout this country. Dr. Cotton has exhibited the right attitude, the steadfastness to work for the betterment of all students that enter the doors of DSA.She is one person. She wore many hats, some of them were very \"Hard hats.\" I strongly suggest that instead of spewing hatefulness,, .rollup your sleeves, go to the school, volunteer, tutor ,, spend some time there.",

I felt the staff cared more about the new building than the lives of the students. Sure the school had security and metal detectors but they were inefficient. There was a high turnover of teachers and subs. They did a good job getting students into college but many are unprepared. They have great ideas but poor implementation. Removing my child was the best decision I've ever made regarding her education. Compared to other DPS schools it's better than average but compared to other Michigan schools, DSA is substandard.",

How many times can you tell your child to be the bigger person and walk away? Everyday he had an altercation with someone. This School needs to be shut down! This School has no order at all. A lot of the kids are disrespectful, no lights in the hall way, leaking ceilings in the classrooms and in the gym. If you love your child please don't send him/her to this School. I'm rating it one star because I have too but this School is very very bad.",

My child has been bullied since the start of the school year and they still haven't taken care of the problem. And to make matters worse the lunch staff is rude to the children. This is our first year ever dealing with DPS and our last. I don't want to send my child to another Michigan school.",

I wish i could get my kids to school at Spain I'd switch them back. A very sad and disappointed mother here. :'(",

I was finally happy to see that my students were being challenged academically and with forensics and other extras there were many outlets for students to express themselves. I was most disappointed and eventually removed my children due to the willingness to retain students with struggles instead of exercising concern and assistance to dig to the root of the problem. If your child is ADD, ADHD or has any other learning disability or possible disability, I cannot recommend this school. I brought my concerns and suspicions to both teachers and principal and the best they could do was to insist upon retention if we returned to St. Clare. I ultimately decided not to. The fallout, my children lost their circles that were developing quite nicely. That is sad to say especially given my oldest was entering 7th grade. Yet this was the right decision my youngest, who St. Clare, wanted to retain. He is in his proper grade and doing much better. With the help of his new school he is receiving the testing and teacher collaboration that was needed to help him be a successful student.",

It is diverse racially, economically, and spiritually. The children and teachers are hard-working and inspiring. The parents are involved and committed. There is a slew of after school activities from knitting club to the annual school musical -- which features a live orchestra and sells out the War Memorial theater for multiple performances every year. If you want your child to be challenged academically in an atmosphere that will prepare them for the real world, you cannot do better than St. Clare!

The principal hardly ever comes out of her office. And the security are the worst. The school is just rigged, corrupted whatever the word is. But there are good qualities. Like the counselors and the teachers that care. You have to know the right people. That phrase goes two ways.",

Dr. Denise Davis-Cotton, the founder of DSA had a vision in which she was able to bring to fruition by talking with people such as Max Fisher, and other \"movers and shakers\" to get the process of building a school so that students that were creative, talented , scholarly, and interested in working towards excellence would be able to achieve their respective goals. Inasmuch as she did this, to vilify the school, the curriculum, and the staff is too much. As a former educator in the DPS, I fully understand and recognize the fact that there are problems in many schools, whether they are DPS schools or schools throughout this country. Dr. Cotton has exhibited the right attitude, the steadfastness to work for the betterment of all students that enter the doors of DSA.She is one person. She wore many hats, some of them were very \"Hard hats.\" I strongly suggest that instead of spewing hatefulness,, .rollup your sleeves, go to the school, volunteer, tutor ,, spend some time there.",

I felt the staff cared more about the new building than the lives of the students. Sure the school had security and metal detectors but they were inefficient. There was a high turnover of teachers and subs. They did a good job getting students into college but many are unprepared. They have great ideas but poor implementation. Removing my child was the best decision I've ever made regarding her education. Compared to other DPS schools it's better than average but compared to other Michigan schools, DSA is substandard.",
